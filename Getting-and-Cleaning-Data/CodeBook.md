Getting and Cleaning Data. Project Codebook
========================================================

This file describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.

The data used in this project represents data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. It was downloaded from this [link](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) and it's fully described at this [link](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
